<p>Beerio Party Rules</p>
<p>For N people</p>
<h1 id="yellow">YELLOW</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don't pee in my soup - Each person gets a bowl and fills it with a comfortable amount of beer. A pea is put in each of three bowls. A ~1minute timer is started and each person tries to scoop the pea out of their beer and into their neighbor on the right's bowl. If there's a pea in your bowl when the timer goes off, you drink your soup and eat the pea. Repeat until there is a one on one showdown.</li>
<li>“200” - 50 was good</li>
<li>Draw a picture blindfolded - awesome, simple clip art picture, FaceTime moms for judge</li>
<li>Relay - fun</li>
<li>Titties - great, 1 titty bounce one double bounce</li>
<li>Bangers 'n' Mash - good (throw ball at beer)</li>
<li>Fuck yes - quick and fun</li>
<li>Pudding pals - great, everyone vs one? (play at your own risk for teams &gt;4)</li>
<li>Burrito buds - fantastic</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="blue">BLUE</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pump hump n away - Balloon individual and teams</li>
<li>Blowball</li>
<li>Tanks/artillery - Pair up! One person is referee/ball finder and automatically gets 5 coins. Each pair has a blind &quot;tank&quot; and a seeing guide. The tanks are in an enclosed area that the seers cant go. The seers yell to their tanks where to find balls (or pillows?) and then where to throw them. If the referee sees a person get hit, they're out. Last tank alive wins for the team</li>
<li>Unicorn (cup on your head beer pong, ride in like a horse) (one unicorn, corn taped to head, two teams try to get pong ball into corn. Teams have to stay behind their couches)</li>
<li>Soap dispenser beer dispenser. Empty out the soap dispenser and jerk off beer into teammates mouth.</li>
<li>ELIZABETH!! Each team has a hider, a seeker, and a cartographer. The hider and corresponding cartographer go out into the field and hide a beer. The cartographer then runs back to base and draws a map to that beer as fast as they can with their off hand. The opposing team drinks one beer per person (and one cup of water if they're short a person) in series. When the last beer is finished on the opposing team, the cartographer must stop drawing. When your team finishes their last beer, the seeker may take the map from the cartographer and search for the beer. The cartographer does not need to give up the map at this moment, but they may give it up anytime after that. NO WORDS ON THE MAP, ONLY ARROWS AND SHAPES AND SHIT. THE LETTER X IS ACCEPTABLE. THE CARTOGRAPHER MUST BE SILENT ALL NIGHT.</li>
<li>Pin the Tail on the Donkey</li>
<li>Hummingbeers (beer ice cube tray sucker) (drink them with straws)</li>
<li>Quarters - N Rounds, at the start of each round each person takes a shot of beer and then tries to bounce their quarter into one of the central shot glasses. Last Math.ceil(N/3) person to get a quarter in the glass gets removed</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="red">RED</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Shot blinders - GREAT GAME, 7 peeks per minute (for 3 people.)</li>
<li>Flip cup</li>
<li>Ping Pong Paddle Pairs</li>
<li>Hide n drink - great success, seeker has to pour and drink 3 shots of beer</li>
<li>Vietnam war (Civil war except for 1 person hits a normal rack of 6, and all other people have to hit 1 island each)</li>
<li>Ping pong slingshot (Bowling? Shoot people in a line?)</li>
<li>Whose butt is it anyways (headphones required) - hilarious</li>
<li>Snowball Upchuck - Throw the snowball up in the air, everyone looks at the ground. If the snowball hits you in the head you're out.</li>
<li>Launch Butts - just like Avalanche but with the slingshot and ping pong balls</li>
